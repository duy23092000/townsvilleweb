	<h1> CP3402 - Project Plan</h1>
	<h2>Name: Nguyen Quang Duy</h2>
	<p><strong> Student web URL: <a href="http://ditwebtsv.jcu.edu.au/~jc516091/Assignment2/">http://ditwebtsv.jcu.edu.au/~jc516091/Assignment2/</a></strong></p>
	<h2> Goals:</h2>
	<p>Membership</p>
	<li>One of our goal is to recruit new members joining the Townsville Community Music Centre. This could be done by procedures such as interviews or completing surveys. Ones who are potential will be recruited to our centre.</li>
<li>We also hope to increase coordination between members within the centre, including: volunteering for administration, organising and promoting concerts and workshops. In order to achieve this, we need everyone in the group to be responsible and active while contributing to the centre.</li>
<p>Concerts</p>
<li>Another goal that we hope to achieve is to sell more tickets and focus more to the general public. This could be done my the marketing department through posting advertisements of our centre to the social media so that more attention is grabbed. We may also need to reduce the prices of the tickets to encourage sales.</li>
<li>Performers are also needed to be encouraged since they play a very important role in our concerts. Our goal is to encourage these performers to let us organise a concert for them. This could be done by sending proper formal letters to these performers so that they would not refuse performing in our concert. </li>
<li>We also aim to encourage performers to collaborate with promotion, photo shoots, media releases, etc. This could be done if performers were successfully performed and they are confident; once this happens, they may help our goal comes true.</li>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> Increasing tickets sales goal could be evaluated by recording the number of views of the website. This would help us determine how many potential customers are ready to buy our concert tickets. </p>
<p> Other goals relating to human resource such as performers and centre members would be evaluated by their replies after our requests.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>This website targets people who love music who want to listen to music and play music. This may include ones who would like to perform, which may help us recruit more members, and who would want to buy our concert tickets.</p>
<p>Depending on the types of music being performed, the target audience is different. For example, we would target teenagers and young people when there are rock and EDM shows, while elders would be targeted instead if country music concerts are organized.</p>
<p>We also aim other organisations that would sponsor our concert by publishing this website. This would help our centre reduce costs and reach wider audience.</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>These are what should be displayed on the website:</p>
<li>Home page: This would come first when we first enter the website url, that would display navigation bar.</li>
